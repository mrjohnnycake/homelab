What about installing and assigning an SSD to the Backups VM that I can sync to and then using a script to move those files over after?
	- Which would be faster and would it be worth it?
	- I don't know if that would even work since rsync couldn't read what was on the zpool first to know what to upload


- Figure out how to sync Wiki.js to Github



```
sudo rsync -av --info=progress -e "ssh -i /home/administrator/.ssh/machine-keys/backups_vm-to-restic_vm" /mnt/Deep-13/Media/Video/movies/ administrator@192.168.40.101:/mnt/Backups/Video/movies

sudo rsync -av --info=progress -e "ssh -i /home/administrator/.ssh/tomservo-to-crow-videos" /mnt/Deep-13/Media/Video/ dave@192.168.10.10:/mnt/Deep-13/Media/Video/
```

- Run rsync backups (delete each line here as they're run)

```
sudo rsync -av --info=progress -e "ssh -i /home/administrator/.ssh/machine-keys/backups_vm-to-restic_vm" /mnt/Deep-13/Media/Video/shows/ administrator@192.168.40.101:/mnt/Backups/Video/shows
```

- Implement cron jobs for running Restic backups
	- Document in [Backup and Maintenance](Backup%20and%20Maintenance.md)
	- If cron has issues, consider the .ssh/config file since it's in the `administrator` directory rather than the `root` folder, since `root` will be running the crontab

# Moving From the Cloud #

- Photos
	- How would taking photos work?
		- They save to the phone
		- Some app (syncthing?) gets them to the server(s)
	- How would Anna (and the rest of us) access them?
	- I could only transition to this setup if...
		- Gypsy is fully functional
		- The family knows how to get all of our photos (and other data) if I were gone

Docker
- [Dockersocket](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy)
- Check into each docker image I have installed to see if there are any security issues with the image or developer or if the image is no longer being developed
- As far as security with docker goes, just use different networks based on use cases (internal, external, whether or not they need to talk to each other, etc.) ???
